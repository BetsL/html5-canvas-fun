# html5-canvas-fun
Code, meet Canvas. Receipt:  grab canvas, grab context; establish height + width away from default, base settings with stroke styles; destructure an array with [lastX, lastY] = [e.offsetX, e.offsetY]; set a flag; use event information for mouse movement to draw on canvas context. Know pure joy.

// This type of application of coding makes me unspeakably happy, both as an artsy-person and as an educator-person, who cares about the value of assistive technology in giving everyone a voice.
